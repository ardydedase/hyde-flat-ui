{% mark excerpt -%}

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business 
partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
remember your business partner 
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember 
your business partner Marsellus 
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and 
Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.
